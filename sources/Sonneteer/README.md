# Luminescent Sonnets

These encoded examples began life in the **Sonneteer**, an early (some might say venerable) text encoding demonstration that helped, once, to show the utility of text encoding (specifically, declarative XML tagging) in a modest but provocative 'Digital Humanities' application.

They have been slightly modified to fit within the constraints of xMNML - no annotations have annotation and structure.

The markup is also pretty bare-bones. But enough for the purpose of demonstration.

See an archived copy of the original project in the developer's repository at https://wendellpiez.github.io/PellucidLiterature/Sonneteer/index.html.

## Pipelines

WFCHECK-BATCH.xpl attempts to parse all examples and reports findings.
