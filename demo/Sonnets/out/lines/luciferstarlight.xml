            <line>On a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose.</line>
            <line>Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiend</line>
            <line>Above the rolling ball in cloud part screened,</line>
            <line>Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.</line>
            <line>And now upon his western wing he leaned,</line>
            <line>Now his huge bulk o'er Afric's sands careened,</line>
            <line>Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.</line>
         </quatrain>
      </octave>
      <sestet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scars</line>
            <line>With memory of the old revolt from Awe,</line>
            <line>He reached a middle height, and at the stars,</line>
         </tercet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Which are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.</line>
            <line>Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,</line>
            <line>The army of unalterable law.</line>
         </tercet>
      </sestet>
   </sonnet>
