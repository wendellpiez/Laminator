            <line>She is as in a field a silken tent</line>
            <line>At midday when the sunny summer breeze</line>
            <line>Has dried the dew and all its ropes relent,</line>
            <line>So that in guys it gently sways at ease,</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>And its supporting central cedar pole,</line>
            <line>That is its pinnacle to heavenward</line>
            <line>And signifies the sureness of the soul,</line>
            <line>Seems to owe naught to any single cord,</line>
         </quatrain>
      </octave>
      <sestet>
         <quatrain>
            <line>But strictly held by none, is loosely bound</line>
            <line>By countless silken ties of love and thought</line>
            <line>To every thing on earth the compass round,</line>
            <line>And only by one's going slightly taut</line>
         </quatrain>
         <couplet>
            <line>In the capriciousness of summer air</line>
            <line>Is of the slightest bondage made aware.</line>
         </couplet>
      </sestet>
