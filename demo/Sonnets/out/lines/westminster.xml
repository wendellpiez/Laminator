            <line>Earth has not anything to show more fair:</line>
            <line>Dull would he be of soul who could pass by</line>
            <line>A sight so touching in its majesty:</line>
            <line>This City now doth, like a garment, wear</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,</line>
            <line>Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie</line>
            <line>Open unto the fields, and to the sky;</line>
            <line>All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.</line>

            <line>Never did sun more beautifully steep</line>
            <line>In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;</line>
            <line>Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!</line>
            <line>The river glideth at his own sweet will:</line>

         <couplet>
            <line>Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;</line>
