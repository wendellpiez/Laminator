            <line>Nay I have done, you get no more of me;</line>
            <line>And I am glad, yea, glad with all my heart,</line>
            <line>That thus so cleanly I myself can free;</line>

            <line>Shake hands for ever, cancel all our vows,</line>
            <line>And when we meet at any time again,</line>
            <line>Be it not seen in either of our brows</line>
            <line>That we one lot of former love retain.</line>

            <line>Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,</line>
            <line>When his pulse failing, passion speechless lies,</line>
            <line>When faith is kneeling by his bed of death,</line>
            <line>And innocence is closing up his eyes,</line>
         </quatrain>
         <couplet>
            <line>— Now if thou would'st, when all have given him over,</line>
            <line>From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!</line>
