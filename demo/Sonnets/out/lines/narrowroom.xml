            <line>Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room</line>
            <line>And hermits are contented with their cells;</line>
            <line>And students with their pensive citadels;</line>
            <line>Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,</line>
            <line>High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells,</line>
            <line>Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:</line>
            <line>In truth the prison, into which we doom</line>
         </quatrain>
      </octave>
      <sestet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,</line>
            <line>In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound</line>
            <line>Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;</line>
         </tercet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be)</line>
            <line>Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,</line>
            <line>Should find brief solace there, as I have found.</line>
