            <line>It is a lofty feeling, yet a kind,</line>
            <line>Thus to be topped with leaves; — to have a sense</line>
            <line>Of honour-shaded thought, — an influence</line>
            <line>As from great nature's fingers, and be twined</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>With her old, sacred, verdurous ivy-bind,</line>
            <line>As though she hallowed with that sylvan fence</line>
            <line>A head that bows to her benevolence,</line>
            <line>Midst pomp of fancied trumpets in the wind.</line>

            <line>It is what's within us crowned. And kind and great</line>
            <line>Are all the conquering wishes it inspires,</line>
            <line>Love of things lasting, love of the tall woods,</line>
         </tercet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Love of love's self, and ardour for a state</line>
            <line>Of natural good befitting such desires,</line>
            <line>Towns without gain, and hunted solitudes.</line>
