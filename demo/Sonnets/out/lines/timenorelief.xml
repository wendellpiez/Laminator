   <octave>
      <line>Time does not bring relief; you all have lied</line>
      <line>Who told me time would ease me of my pain!</line>
      <line>I miss him in the weeping of the rain;</line>
      <line>I want him at the shrinking of the tide;</line>
      <line>The old snows melt from every mountain-side,</line>
      <line>And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;</line>
      <line>But last year's bitter loving must remain</line>
      <line>Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!</line>
   </octave>
   <sestet>
      <line>There are a hundred places where I fear</line>
      <line>To go,--so with his memory they brim!</line>
      <couplet>
         <line>And entering with relief some quiet place</line>
         <line>Where never fell his foot or shone his face</line>
      </couplet>
      <line>I say, "There is no memory of him here!"</line>
      <line>And so stand stricken, so remembering him!</line>
   </sestet>
