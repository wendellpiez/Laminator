            <line>O Earth lie heavily upon her eyes;</line>
            <line>Seal her sweet eyes weary of watching, Earth.</line>
            <line>Lie close around her, leave no room for mirth</line>
            <line>With its harsh laughter, nor for sound of sighs.</line>

         <quatrain>
            <line>She hath no questions, she hath no replies,</line>
            <line>Hushed in and curtained with a blessed dearth</line>
            <line>Of all that irked her from her hour of birth;</line>
            <line>With stillness that is almost Paradise.</line>

            <line>Darkness more clear than noon-day holdeth her,</line>
            <line>Silence more musical than any song;</line>
            <line>Even her very heart hath ceased to stir;</line>
         </tercet>
         <tercet>
            <line>Until the morning of Eternity</line>
            <line>Her rest shall not begin nor end, but be,</line>
            <line>And when she wakes she will not think it long.</line>
