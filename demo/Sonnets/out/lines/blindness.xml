            <line>When I consider how my light is spent,</line>
            <line>Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,</line>
            <line>And that one talent which is death to hide,</line>
            <line>Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent</line>

         <quatrain>
            <line>To serve therewith my maker, and present</line>
            <line>My true account, lest he returning chide,</line>
            <line>Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?</line>
            <line>I fondly ask; but Patience to prevent</line>

            <line>Is kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed</line>
            <line>And post o'er land and ocean without rest:</line>
