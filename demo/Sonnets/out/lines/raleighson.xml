            <line>Three things there be that prosper up apace</line>
            <line>And flourish, whilst they grow asunder far;</line>
            <line>But on a day, they meet all in one place,</line>
            <line>And when they meet, they one another mar.</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>And they be these: the wood, the weed, the wag.</line>
            <line>The wood is that which makes the gallow tree;</line>
            <line>The weed is that which strings the hangman's bag;</line>
            <line>The wag, my pretty knave, betokeneth thee.</line>

            <line>Mark well, dear boy, whilst these assemble not,</line>
            <line>Green springs the tree, hemp grows, the wag is wild;</line>
            <line>But when they meet, it makes the timber rot,</line>
            <line>It frets the halter, and it chokes the child.</line>
         </quatrain>
         <couplet>
            <line>Then bless thee, and beware, and let us pray</line>
            <line>We part not with thee at this meeting day.</line>
