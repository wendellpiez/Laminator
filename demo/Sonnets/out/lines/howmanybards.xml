            <line>How many bards gild the lapses of time!</line>
            <line>A few of them have ever been the food</line>
            <line>Of my delighted fancy,—I could brood</line>
            <line>Over their beauties, earthly, or sublime:</line>
         </quatrain>
         <quatrain>
            <line>And often, when I sit me down to rhyme,</line>
            <line>These will in throngs before my mind intrude:</line>
            <line>But no confusion, no disturbance rude</line>
            <line>Do they occasion; ’tis a pleasing chime.</line>

      </octave>
      <sestet>
         <quatrain>
            <line>So the unnumber’d sounds that evening store;</line>
            <line>The songs of birds—the whisp’ring of the leaves—</line>
            <line>The voice of waters—the great bell that heaves</line>
            <line>With solemn sound,—and thousand others more,</line>
         </quatrain>
         <couplet>
            <line>That distance of recognizance bereaves,</line>
            <line>Make pleasing music, and not wild uproar.</line>
