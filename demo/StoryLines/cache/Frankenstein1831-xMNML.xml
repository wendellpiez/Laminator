habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay, near
Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me
then. They were the eyry of freedom, and the pleasant region where unheeded I
could commune with the creatures of my fancy. I wrote then — but in a
most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to
our house, on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true
compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered. I did
not make myself the heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place
an affair as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes
or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own
identity, and I could people the hours with creations far more interesting to
me at that age, than my own sensations.</text>

pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he
had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his race, whose

brilliant imagery, and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our
language, than to invent the machinery of a story, commenced one founded on the
experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a
skull- headed lady, who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole —
to see what I forget — something very shocking and wrong of course; but
when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of Coventry, he
did not know what to do with her, and was obliged to despatch her to the tomb
of the Capulets, the only place for which she was fitted. The illustrious poets
also, annoyed the platitude of prose, speedily relinquished their uncongenial
task.</text>

beginning must be linked to something that went before. The Hindoos give the
world an elephant to support it, but they make the elephant stand upon a
tortoise. Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating
out of the void, but out of chaos; the materials must, in the first place, be
afforded: it can give form to dark, shapeless substances, but cannot bring into
being the substance itself. In all matters of discovery and invention, even of
those that appertain to the imagination, we are continually reminded of the
story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on
the capabilities of a subject, and in the power of moulding and fashioning
ideas suggested to it.</text>

with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely
frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous

would rush away from his odious handywork, horror-stricken. He would hope that,
left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had communicated would fade;

fancy, I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural

the disadvantages of a mere tale of spectres or enchantment. It was recommended
by the novelty of the situations which it develops, and however impossible as a

society which cannot cease to be regretted. I passed the summer of 1816 in the
environs of Geneva. The season was cold and rainy, and in the evenings we
crowded around a bluing wood fire and occasionally amused ourselves with some
German stories of ghosts which happened to fall into our hands. These tales
excited in us a playful desire of imitation. Two other friends (a tale from the
pen of one of whom would be far more acceptable to the public than anything I
can ever hope to produce) and myself agreed to write each a story founded on

which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a
foretaste of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams
become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is
the seat of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as
the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is forever visible,
its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding
navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm
sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every

fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with
the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates,
on an expedition of discovery up his native river. But supposing all these
conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I
shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage
near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all

expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with
ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect
of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the
pole. You may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of
discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas' library. My
education was neglected, yet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes
were my study day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret
which I had felt, as a child, on learning that my father's dying
injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring

even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great
enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the
whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured
cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common
sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the
theory of medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval
adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually
hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to
admiration. I must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the
second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.</text>

repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution and too
impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me that I am
self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common

became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country; but it was only
when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from
such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with
more languages than that of my native country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in
reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have
thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they
want (as the painters call it) keeping; and I greatly need a friend who would
have sense enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
endeavour to regulate my mind.</text>

discipline. This circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless
courage, made me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my
best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to the
usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be
necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of
heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt myself
peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard of him first
in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her
life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved a young Russian lady
of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money, the
father of the girl consented to the match. He saw his mistress once before the
destined ceremony; but she was bathed in tears, and throwing herself at his
feet, entreated him to spare her, confessing at the same time that she loved
another, but that he was poor, and that her father would never consent to the
union. My generous friend reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the
name of her lover, instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a
farm with his money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his
life; but he bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
woman's father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old man
decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who, when he
found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned until he heard
that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations.

disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my passionate
enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most
imaginative of modern poets. There is something at work in my soul which I do
not understand. I am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to
execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for

which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and
unvisited regions I am about to explore.</text>

are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the floating sheets of ice that
continually pass us, indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are
advancing, appear to dismay them. We have already reached a very high latitude;
but it is the height of summer, and although not so warm as in England, the
southern gales, which blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently
desire to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not
expected.</text>

the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which she floated.
Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we were compassed round by
a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to, hoping that some change would take
place in the atmosphere and weather.</text>

in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to have no
end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to grow watchful with
anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and
diverted our solicitude from our own situation. We perceived a low carriage,
fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance
of half a mile; a being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of
gigantic stature, sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid
progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice. </text>

body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering. I never saw a man in so
wretched a condition. We attempted to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as
he had quitted the fresh air he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the
deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him
to swallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him
up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove. By slow
degrees he recovered and ate a little soup, which restored him

much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more interesting creature: his eyes
have generally an expression of wildness, and even madness, but there are
moments when, if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any
the most trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were,
with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he is
generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his teeth, as if

destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer with any degree

apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although
unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests
himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently conversed with me
on mine, which I have communicated to him without disguise. He entered
attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into
every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it. I was easily led
by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart, to give
utterance to the burning ardour of my soul, and to say, with all the fervour
that warmed me, how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every
hope, to the furtherance of my enterprise. One man's life or death were
but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought,
for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our
race. As I spoke, a dark gloom spread over my listener's countenance. At
first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands
before his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle
fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I paused;

wonderful man. Sometimes I have endeavoured to discover what quality it is
which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person I

perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled
misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should
die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification
of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not
know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I
reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same
dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt
moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking
and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are
usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might
fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will
appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the
laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I
doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of
the events of which it is composed.</text>

when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but
a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient
to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to
procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The interval
was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became more deep and
rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at length it took so fast hold

circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
There was a sense of justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it
necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former
years he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and
so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a show of
gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a
desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she
had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her.
Everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to
shelter her, as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher
wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion
in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her
hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after their
union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change of scene and
interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for
her weakened frame.</text>

daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five years
old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they passed a
week on the shores of the lake of Como. Their benevolent disposition often made
them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my mother, was more than a duty;
it was a necessity, a passion—remembering what she had suffered, and how
she had been relieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to
the afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number of
half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape. One
day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother, accompanied by me,
visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down
by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Along
these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She
appeared of a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little
vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the brightest living
gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed to set a crown of
distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless,
and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and
sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct
species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her

admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was not
her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a German and
had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with these good people
to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been long married, and their
eldest child was but just born. The father of their charge was one of those
Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of Italy—one among the
schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his
country. He became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still
lingered in the dungeons of Austria was not known. His property was
confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued with her
foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a garden rose among
dark-leaved brambles.</text>

shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the
chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his permission my
mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her. They
were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed a blessing to them, but
it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when Providence
afforded her such powerful protection. They consulted their village priest, and
the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parent's

ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or
dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and the diversity and
contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together. Elizabeth
was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition; but, with all my ardour, I
was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the
thirst for knowledge. She busied herself with following the aerial creations of
the poets; and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss
home—the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of our
Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight. While my
companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent
appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their causes. The world was
to me a secret which I desired to divine. Curiosity, earnest research to learn
the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to
me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember.</text>

Geneva. He was a boy of singular talent and fancy. He loved enterprise,
hardship, and even danger for its own sake. He was deeply read in books of
chivalry and romance. He composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale
of enchantment and knightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to
enter into masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous train who
shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the
infidels.</text>

known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always having been
imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature. In spite of
the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers, I always
came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied. Sir Isaac Newton is said to
have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and
unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his successors in each branch of natural
philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's
apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.</text>

It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century; but
while I followed the routine of education in the schools of Geneva, I was, to a
great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite studies. My father was
not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added
to a student's thirst for knowledge. Under the guidance of my new
preceptors I entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the
philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon obtained
my undivided attention. Wealth was an inferior object, but what glory would

was at once new and astonishing to me. All that he said threw greatly into the

pursue my accustomed studies. It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever

By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in
early youth, I at once gave up my former occupations, set down natural history
and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation, and entertained the
greatest disdain for a would be science which could never even step within the

that rude hand rent away some dear connection? And why should I describe a

grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and the smile that plays upon

therefore, did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits. In rather a too
philosophical and connected a strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the
conclusions I had come to concerning them in my early years. As a child I had
not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
science. With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth
and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the steps of knowledge
along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for
the dreams of forgotten alchemists. Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of
modern natural philosophy. It was very different when the masters of the
science sought immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand;
but now the scene was changed. The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was
chiefly founded. I was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for
realities of little worth.</text>

comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation. I read with
ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination, which modern
inquirers have written on these subjects. I attended the lectures and
cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university, and I
found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information,
combined, it is true, with a repulsive physiognomy and manners, but not on that
account the less valuable. In M. Waldman I found a true friend. His gentleness
was never tinged by dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of
frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. In a thousand
ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. My application was at first
fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so
ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning
whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.</text>

asked me, with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. Two years passed in
this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was engaged, heart and
soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I hoped to make. None but those
who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science. In other
studies you go as far as others have gone before you, and there is nothing more
to know; but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and
wonder. A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who continually
sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in
this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries
in the improvement of some chemical instruments, which procured me great esteem
and admiration at the university. When I had arrived at this point and had
become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my residence
there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought of returning to
my friends and my native town, when an incident happened that protracted my

many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or
carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances in
my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those
branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had been

father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should he impressed with
no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of
superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no
effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of
bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had
become food for the worm. Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My
attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of
the human feelings. I saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I
beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how
the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change from life
to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this darkness a sudden
light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple,
that while I became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it
illustrated, I was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed
their inquiries towards the same science, that I alone should be reserved to
discover so astonishing a secret.</text>

whether I should attempt the creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler
organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to
permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and
wonderful as man. The materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should

many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could
claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs.

this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken
your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which
no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to
say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man
allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his
domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved, Caesar would have spared his

year had withered before my work drew near to a close, and now every day showed
me more plainly how well I had succeeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my
anxiety, and I appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines,

employment. Every night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous
to a most painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my
fellow creatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed
at the wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone
sustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and

her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my
dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms
crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a
cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became
convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way
through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster
whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes
they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken,
but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I
escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the
house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking
up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and
fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal
corpse to which I had so miserably given life.</text>

alive and walking about. I dreaded to behold this monster, but I feared still
more that Henry should see him. Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few
minutes at the bottom of the stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand
was already on the lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused,

perhaps dangers of so long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being

the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me,
and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around
me. Since you left us, but one change has taken place in our little household.
Do you remember on what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably
you do not; I will relate her history, therefore, in a few words. Madame
Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the
third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a
strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M.
Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was
twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house.
The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier
manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.
Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants;
and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a
servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned
the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not
include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human
being.</text>

gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so frank-hearted and
happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her, by which she was induced
to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended. This
benefit was fully repaid; Justine was the most grateful little creature in the
world: I do not mean that she made any professions; I never heard one pass her
lips, but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate, yet she
paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She thought her the
model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners,
so that even now she often reminds me of her.</text>

troubled; she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgment
from heaven to chastise her partiality. She was a Roman Catholic, and I believe
her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few
months after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her
repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she was much
altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness and a winning
mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity. Nor was
her residence at her mother's house of a nature to restore her gaiety. The
poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance. She sometimes begged Justine
to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the
deaths of her brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame
Moritz into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace forever. She died on the first approach of cold weather, at the

several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a kind of
rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained. Ever since
the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the beginning of my misfortunes, I
had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy. When
I was otherwise quite restored to health, the sight of a chemical instrument
would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this and had
removed all my apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment, for he
perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been
my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of no avail when I visited
the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture when he praised, with kindness and
warmth, the astonishing progress I had made in the sciences. He soon perceived
that I disliked the subject, but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my
feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science
itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What could I do?
He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he had placed carefully,
one by one, in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in
putting me to a slow and cruel death. I writhed under his words yet dared not
exhibit the pain I felt. Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in
discerning the sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse,
his total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I thanked
my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly that he was
surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from me; and although I
loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds, yet I
could never persuade myself to confide to him that event which was so often
present to my recollection but which I feared the detail to another would only
impress more deeply.</text>

literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He came to
the university with the design of making himself complete master of the
Oriental languages, as thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had
marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no inglorious career, he turned his
eyes towards the East as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise. The
Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit languages engaged his attention, and I was easily
induced to enter on the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and
now that I wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies, I felt
great relief in being the fellow pupil with my friend, and found not only
instruction but consolation in the works of the Orientalists. I did not, like
him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for I did not contemplate
making any other use of them than temporary amusement. I read merely to
understand their meaning, and they well repaid my labours. Their melancholy is
soothing, and their joy elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying
the authors of any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns of a fair
enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How different from the manly
and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!</text>

endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own! A selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed
and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature who, a few years ago,

exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled his
soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing; his
conversation was full of imagination, and very often, in imitation of the
Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion.

which he supported with great ingenuity.</text>

taken place; but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked
other alterations, which, although they were done more tranquilly, might not be

lightnings playing on the summit of Mont Blanc in the most beautiful figures.

The storm, as is often the case in Switzerland, appeared at once in various
parts of the heavens. The most violent storm hung exactly north of the town,
over that part of the lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the
village of Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes, and
another darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to
the east of the lake.</text>

gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood fixed,
gazing intently; I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning illuminated the
object and discovered its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature, and the
deformity of its aspect, more hideous than belongs to humanity, instantly armed
me that it was the wretch, the filthy demon to whom I had given life. What did
he there? Could he be (I shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my
brother? No sooner did that idea cross my imagination than I became convinced
of its truth; my teeth chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for
support. The figure passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in
human shape could have destroyed that fair child. He was the murderer! I could
not doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
fact. I thought of pursuing the devil, but it would have been in vain, for
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on
the south. He soon reached the summit and disappeared.</text>

I knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made. But I paused when
I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A being whom I myself had formed,
and endued with life, had met me at midnight among the precipices of an
inaccessible mountain. I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had
been seized just at the time that I datelined my creation, and which would give an
air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if
any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it
as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would
elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives
to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit? Who could arrest a
creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These
reflections determined me, and I resolved to remain silent.</text>

discovered, Justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several
days. During this interval one of the servants, happening to examine the
apparel she had worn on the night of the murder, had discovered in her pocket
the picture of my mother, which had been judged to be the temptation of the
murderer. The servant instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without
saying a word to any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their
deposition, Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor
girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
manner.</text>

commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as
witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of this wretched
mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to be decided whether the
result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my
fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy, the other far more
dreadfully murdered, with every aggravation of infamy that could make the
murder memorable in horror. Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed
qualities which promised to render her life happy; now all was to be
obliterated in an ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather
would I have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I
was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have been
considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who
suffered through me.</text>

exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not
tremble, although gazed on and execrated by thousands, for all the kindness
which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of
the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have
committed. She was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained;
and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the court she
threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated. A tear</text>

several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined against her,
which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as I
had. She had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been
committed and towards morning had been perceived by
a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had
been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she did there, but she looked
very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer. She
returned to the house about eight o'clock, and when one inquired where she
had passed the night, she replied that she had been looking for the child and
demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the
body, she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when
Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same which, an hour
before the child had been missed, she had placed round his neck, a murmur of
horror and indignation filled the court.</text>

return, at about nine o'clock, she met a man who asked her if she had seen
anything of the child who was lost. She was alarmed by this account and passed
several hours in looking for him, when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she
was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a
cottage, being unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well
known. Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed
that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke. It
was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour to find my
brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay, it was without her
knowledge. That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was
not surprising, since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor
William was yet uncertain. Concerning the picture she could give no

the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame
Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and
care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a
manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again
lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She
was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on

worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction and
certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear. Justine
died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed freely in my veins, but a
weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove.
Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed
deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded
myself) was yet behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of
virtue. I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.
Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to
look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and from thence to gather
promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt, which
hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can
describe.</text>

o'clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had
rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome to me. I was now
free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the
boat and passed many hours upon the water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was
carried by the wind; and sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I
left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable
reflections. I was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the

Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of unalterable evils,
and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate
some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he
would still commit some signal crime, which by its enormity should almost
efface the recollection of the past. There was always scope for fear so long as
anything I loved remained behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be
conceived. When I thought of him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed,
and I ardently wished to extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly
bestowed. When I reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge
burst all bounds of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest
peak of the Andes, could I when there have precipitated him to their base. I
wished to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on
his head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.</text>

on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no
longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I
looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard
from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were
remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has
come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's
blood, Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be
guilty, and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered,
assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the
sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a
child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had
been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but
certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society
of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel, she was innocent; you are of the
same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so
like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I
were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding
and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and
perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for
the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.</text>

sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable sensations. It
was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left my home, and bending my
steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought in the magnificence, the eternity
of such scenes, to forget myself and my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My
wanderings were directed towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it
frequently during my boyhood. Six years had passed since then: I was a wreck,
but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.</text>

rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the middle of the month of
August, nearly two months after the death of Justine, that miserable epoch from
which I datelined all my woe. The weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I
plunged yet deeper in the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices

assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character. Ruined castles hanging on
the precipices of piny mountains, the impetuous Arve, and cottages every here
and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.
But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and

opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it. Soon
after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This valley is more wonderful and
sublime, but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of Servox, through which
I had just passed. The high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries,
but I saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers
approached the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and magnificent Mont
Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles, and its tremendous dome
overlooked the valley.</text>

recognized, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
light-hearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing accents,
and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the kindly influence
ceased to act— I found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in
all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my animal, striving so to
forget the world, my fears, and more than all, myself—or, in a more
desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on the grass, weighed down by
horror and despair.</text>

sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that with slow
pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley.
The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me; the icy wall of the glacier
overhung me; a few shattered pines were scattered around; and the solemn
silence of this glorious presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by
the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the accumulated
ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws, was ever and anon
rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in their hands. These sublime
and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that I was capable
of receiving. They elevated me from all littleness of feeling, and although
they did not remove my grief, they subdued and tranquillized it. In some
degree, also, they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded
for the last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were, waited
on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I had
contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the unstained snowy
mountaintop, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods, and ragged bare ravine,
the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all gathered round me and bade
me be at peace.</text>

The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the summits of the

would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats. What
were rain and storm to me? My mule was brought to the door, and I resolved to
ascend to the summit of Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of
the tremendous and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first
saw it. It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy. The sight
of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnizing
my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life. I determined to go
without a guide, for I was well acquainted with the path, and the presence of
another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene.</text>

windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain. It
is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots the traces of the winter
avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground,
some entirely destroyed, others bent, leaning upon the jutting rocks of the
mountain or transversely upon other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is
intersected by ravines of snow, down which stones continually roll from above;
one of them is particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even
speaking in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or luxuriant,
but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene. I looked on the
valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and
curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains, whose summits were hid
in the uniform clouds, while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the
melancholy impression I received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man

sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered both that and
the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated the cloud, and I
descended upon the glacier. The surface is very uneven, rising like the waves
of a troubled sea, descending low, and interspersed by rifts that sink deep.
The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in
crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side
where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess of the
rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea, or rather the
vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains, whose aerial summits
hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight
over the clouds. My heart, which was before sorrowful, now swelled with
something like joy; I exclaimed, </text>

being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange
multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the
same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish
between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger
light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness
then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening
my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I
believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or
sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles
which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more
oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where
I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by
the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger
and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries

some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I
experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but
quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the
same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of
the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected
some branches, but they were wet and would not burn. I was pained at this and
sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed
near the heat dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by
touching the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a plentiful
supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with it, I was in the
greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with
dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my
cloak, I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.</text>

this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they
were nearly extinguished. When night came again I found, with pleasure, that
the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was
useful to me in my food, for I found some of the offals that the travellers had
left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered
from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner,
placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries</text>

vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I
resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where
the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration
I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through
accident and knew not how to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious
consideration of this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt
to supply it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood
towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at length
discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night
before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was
disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that
covered the ground.</text>

at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been
built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me, and I
examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered.
An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.
He turned on hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting
the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before
seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the
appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground
was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as
Pandemonium appeared to the demons of hell after their sufferings in the lake
of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd's breakfast,
which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did
not like. Then, overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell
asleep.</text>

of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to
recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant's
breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours,
until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.
The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the
windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these
I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children
shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some
fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other
kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country and fearfully took
refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the
palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a
neat and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I
dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that
I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the
earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it
by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and
rain.</text>

and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a
plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step, and looking through
a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing
before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have
since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed,
a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair
was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost sight of her,
and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail, which was now
partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the
burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.
Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head
and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared.
Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the
field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house
and sometimes in the yard.</text>

before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my

sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable

then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at
his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt

had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find
that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in
watching my human neighbours. In the evening the young girl and her companion
were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old
man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had
enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not
to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
harmony of the old man's instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since
found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of
words or letters.</text>

strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why
were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such
it was in my eyes) and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill
and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and,
still more, they enjoyed one another's company and speech, interchanging
each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they
really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions, but
perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at

cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I felt
depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human
beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their
harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of
my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his
children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their
melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness
that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes
sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived;
but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Felix.
He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my unpractised senses, he
appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance
was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister,
especially when he addressed the old man.</text>

dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want,
Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that
peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning, before she had
risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house,
drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the out-house, where, to
his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an
invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner, yet
brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden, but as there
was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and
Agatha.</text>

possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as
signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to
follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the
endeavour, for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover
myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first
become master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast

Agatha, and the excellent Felix flitted before me. I looked upon them as
superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my

flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the
stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from
her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and
called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not
appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and
dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took
place between him and his father, and the young stranger knelt at the old
man's feet and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her and embraced
her affectionately.</text>

appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by nor
herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not
comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage,
dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Felix seemed
peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the
ever—gentle Agatha, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing
to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been
sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their
countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently
I found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated
after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea
instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the
same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of
them, indeed, were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the
others.</text>

understood the purport of this book had not Felix, in reading it, given very

style was framed in imitation of the Eastern authors. Through this work I
obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at
present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners,
governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of
the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the
Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their
subsequent degenerating—of the decline of that mighty empire, of
chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American
hemisphere and wept with Safie over the hapless fate of its original
inhabitants.</text>

indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and
base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another
as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous
man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base
and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a
condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long
time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and
bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and loathing.</text>

without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond
and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And
what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew
that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the
same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser
diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my
stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around I saw and heard of none like
me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled and

by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of the father of
Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of
her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the bondage to which she was now
reduced. She instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught
her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit
forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons
were indelibly impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of
again returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem, allowed
only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to the temper of
her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue. The
prospect of marrying a Christian and remaining in a country where women were
allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her.</text>

domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and feelings,
which had for their object something out of self, accorded well with my
experience among my protectors and with the wants which were forever alive in
my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a more divine being than I had ever
beheld or imagined; his character contained no pretension, but it sank deep.
The disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with
wonder. I did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined
towards the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely
understanding it.</text>

Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch taught me high
thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections, to
admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many, things I read surpassed my
understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide
extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was perfectly
unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men. The cottage of my
protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature, but
this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest
ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I
understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I
applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of
course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in
preference to Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors
caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first
introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory
and slaughter, I should have been imbued with different sensations.</text>

feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with
his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations,
as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by
no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from
mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect
creature, happy, and prosperous, guarded by, the especial care of his Creator;
he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior
nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan
as the fitter emblem of my condition, for often, like him, when I viewed the
bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me.</text>

dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with
my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my
personal deformity. Could they turn from their door one, however monstrous, who
solicited their compassion and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to
despair, but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would
decide my fate. I postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the
importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.
Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every day's
experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more
months should have added to my sagacity.</text>

degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha spent more time in amusement
and conversation, and were assisted in their labours by servants. They did not
appear rich, but they were contented and happy; their feelings were serene and
peaceful, while mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge
only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I cherished
hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person reflected in water or

gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was

remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had

I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did not heed the bleakness
of the weather; I was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of
cold than heat. But my chief delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds,
and all the gay apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more
attention towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the
absence of summer. They loved and sympathized with one another; and their joys,
depending on each other, were not interrupted by the casualties that took place
around them. The more I saw of them, the greater became my desire to claim
their protection and kindness; my heart yearned to be known and loved by these
amiable creatures; to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection
was the utmost limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn
them from me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a little
food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not believe myself
utterly unworthy of it.</text>

the blind old man should be alone. I had sagacity enough to discover that the
unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those

cottage. Felix darted forward, and with supernatural force tore me from his
father, to whose knees I clung; in a transport of fury, he dashed me to the
ground and struck me violently with a stick. I could have torn him limb from
limb, as the lion rends the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with
bitter sickness, and I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow,
when, overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general

mockery, and the bare trees waved their branches above me; now and then the

Agatha, and the exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a
gush of tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to injure

was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the
recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed
on him, an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had
lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I
could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so
desolate in this peopled earth.</text>

portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the
children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily
arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a
sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from

creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from

the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task
which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again
devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had
heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the
knowledge of which was material to my success, and I some times thought of
obtaining my father's consent to visit England for this purpose; but I
clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me. A
change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had hitherto declined,
was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my
unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure,
and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains
of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a
devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took
refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a
little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves,
silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore

Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to
the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy
and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve
the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest,
when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the
water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base
of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an
avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the
pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the
Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders.
The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look
at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island,
almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group
of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the
recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this
place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or
retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.</text>

white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they
were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of
some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish Armada, Gravesend,

interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well as
Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him. But the
beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic castle and its
environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur's Seat, St.
Bernard's Well, and the Pentland Hills compensated him for the change and
filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was impatient to arrive at

continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely affording
pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its inhabitants, which
consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their
miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they indulged in such luxuries, and
even fresh water, was to be procured from the mainland, which was about five

ordered it to be repaired, bought some furniture, and took possession, an

remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my labour
for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it. As I
sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects
of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was engaged in the same manner
and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and
filled it forever with the bitterest remorse. I was now about to form another
being of whose dispositions I was alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand
times more malignant than her mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and
wretchedness. He had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in
deserts, but she had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a
thinking and reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made
before her creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already
lived loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn
with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him, and he
be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one
of his own species.</text>

light of the moon the demon at the casement. A ghastly grin wrinkled his lips
as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me.

contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to join him.
He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was, that
letters from the friends he had formed in London desired his return to complete
the negotiation they had entered into for his Indian enterprise. He could not
any longer delay his departure; but as his journey to London might be followed,
even sooner than he now conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to
bestow as much of my society on him as I could spare. He besought me,
therefore, to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might
proceed southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and I
determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.</text>

reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I must
enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must handle
those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next morning, at
daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory.
The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had destroyed, lay scattered
on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human
being. I paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber. With trembling
hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room, but I reflected that I ought
not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the
peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket, with a great quantity of
stones, and laying them up, determined to throw them into the sea that very
night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and
arranging my chemical apparatus.</text>

embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again
made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water. Thus situated,
my only resource was to drive before the wind. I confess that I felt a few
sensations of terror. I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted
with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit
to me. I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of
starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and
buffeted around me. I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a
burning thirst, a prelude to my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens,
which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by
others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave. </text>

magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his
son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o'clock, they
observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in for port.
It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at
the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about two miles
below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle, and his
companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding along the sands,
he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground. His
companions came up to assist him, and by the light of their lantern they found
that he had fallen on the body of a man, who was to all appearance dead. Their
first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been
drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves, but on examination they found
that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold. They
instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and
endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it to life. It appeared to be a handsome
young man, about five and twenty years of age. He had apparently been
strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of
fingers on his neck.</text>

nearly to the same spot from which I had departed. Besides, they observed that
it appeared that I had brought the body from another place, and it was likely

dream; yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested
shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that I
was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest companion,
had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I repassed, in my
memory, my whole life—my quiet happiness while residing with my family in
Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for Ingolstadt. I remembered,
shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous
enemy, and I called to mind the night in which he first lived, I was unable to

my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did not afford me
respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects that
scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind of nightmare; I felt the
fiend's grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it; groans and
cries rang in my ears. My father, who was watching over me, perceiving my
restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves were around, the cloudy sky above,
the fiend was not here: a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was
established between the present hour and the irresistible, disastrous future
imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its

kind had presented itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I
preserved in my convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual
silence concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should
be supposed mad, and this in itself would forever have chained my tongue. But,
besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his
breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent
when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret. Yet,
still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me. I
could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part relieved the burden

feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love
and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the angel's arm bared to
drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make her happy. If the monster
executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet, again, I considered whether my
marriage would hasten my fate. My destruction might indeed arrive a few months
sooner, but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by
his menaces, he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of
revenge. He had vowed to be with me on my wedding-night, yet he did not
consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show
me that he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately
after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father's
happiness, my adversary's designs against my life should not retard it a
single hour.</text>

agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any exertion. I threw down

arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier
time and which I had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who
was now but a shadow and a recollection. Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain
had ceased for a moment, and I saw the fish play in the waters as they had done
a few hours before; they had then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so
painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or
the clouds might lower, but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day

William, Elizabeth, and my father reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb
which marked their graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the
trees, which were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and
the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested

Cold, want, and fatigue were the least pains which I was destined to endure; I
was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a
spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would
suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast was
prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The fare was,
indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but I will not doubt
that it was set there by the spirits that I had invoked to aid me. Often, when
all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud

cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were shut
up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize
the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to seek for
prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be procured; and thus
I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.</text>

continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts, until the ocean
appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon. Oh! How
unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south! Covered with ice, it was only
to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness. The
Greeks wept for joy when they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia,
and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I
knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary's gibe, to

traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the fiend
possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had daily lost
ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that when I first saw
the ocean he was but one day's journey in advance, I hoped to intercept
him before he should reach the beach. With new courage, therefore, I pressed
on, and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of
the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information. A
gigantic monster, they said, had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and
many pistols, putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through
fear of his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter food,
and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of
trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same night, to the joy of the
horror-struck villagers, had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction
that led to no land; and they conjectured that he must speedily be</text>

not hope to survive. Yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be

grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured her prey, and I should
soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after the poor animals that conveyed
me had with incredible toll gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain, and
one, sinking under his fatigue, died, I viewed the expanse before me with
anguish, when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I
strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of
ecstasy when I distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a
well-known form within. Oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!

now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes
he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents
with a tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression of the
wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.</text>

infinitely miserable, so destitute of every hope of consolation, to live? Oh,
no! The only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered
spirit to peace and death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude
and delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his fancy, but
the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world. This
faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as

destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a
coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This
sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been
oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those
talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the
work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and
rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors.
But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are
as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in
an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and
application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea
and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion
my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now
exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my
infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk!
Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in
this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny
seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.</text>

for your kind
intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and
fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any
man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the
affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of
our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any
later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however
they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of
our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A
sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown
early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated
with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and
association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice
of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my
ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to
preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught
with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.
But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave
existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.</text>

reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who
have attempted this sea, and in spite of myself, he fills me with cheerful
auguries. Even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence; when he speaks,
they no longer despair; he rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice
they believe these vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish
before the resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny caused by

included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I
refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first

destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite
sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for
vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he

was extended, in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he

tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his face, there was
something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I attempted to speak, but
the words died away on my lips. The monster continued to utter wild and
incoherent self-reproaches. At length I gathered resolution to address him in a
