   <REPORT ranges="said" id="Frankenstein1831">
      <said p="viii">We will each write a ghost story,</said>
      <said p="xi">I have found it! What terrified me will terrify others; / and I need only describe the spectre which had haunted my midnight pillow.</said>
      <said p="8">What a noble fellow!</said>
      <said p="12">Here is our / captain, and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea.</said>
      <said p="12">Before I come on board your / vessel, said he, will you have the kindness to / inform me whither you are bound?</said>
      <said p="13">To seek one who fled from me.</said>
      <said p="13">And did the man whom you pursued travel in / the same fashion?</said>
      <said p="13">Yes.</said>
      <said p="13">Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day / before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, / across the ice.</said>
      <said p="13">I / have, doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good people; / but you are too considerate to make inquiries.</said>
      <said p="13">Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent / and inhuman in me to trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.</said>
      <said p="14">And yet you rescued me from a strange and / perilous situation; you have benevolently restored me to life.</said>
      <said p="15">Unhappy man! / Do you share my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear / me; let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!</said>
      <said p="16">I agree with you, replied the stranger; / we are unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if / one wiser, better, dearer than ourselves—such a friend ought to / be—do not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I / once had a friend, the most noble of human creatures, and am entitled, / therefore, to judge respecting friendship. You have hope, and the world before / you, and have no cause for despair. But I—I have lost everything and / cannot begin life anew.</said>
      <said p="17">You may easily / perceive, Captain Walton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled / misfortunes. I had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should / die with me, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for / knowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the gratification / of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been. I do not / know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet, when I / reflect that you are pursuing the same course, exposing yourself to the same / dangers which have rendered me what I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt / moral from my tale, one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking / and console you in case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are / usually deemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might / fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things will / appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the / laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers of nature; nor can I / doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of / the events of which it is composed.</said>
      <said p="17">I thank you, he replied, / for your sympathy, but it is useless; my fate is / nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I shall repose in peace. I / understand your feeling, continued he, perceiving that I wished to / interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my friend, if / thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my destiny; listen to my / history, and you will perceive bow irrevocably it is determined.</said>
      <said p="22">I have a pretty present for my / Victor—tomorrow he shall have it.</said>
      <said p="26">Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do / not waste your time upon this; it is sad trash.</said>
      <said pp="29-30">My children, she / said, my firmest hopes of future happiness / were placed on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the / consolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to my / younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy and / beloved as I have been, /  / is it not hard to quit you all? / But these are not thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself / cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another / world.</said>
      <said p="32">Have you,</said>
      <said p="32">really spent your time in studying such / nonsense?</said>
      <said p="32">Every minute,</said>
      <said p="32">every instant that / you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost. You have burdened / your memory with exploded systems and useless names. Good God! In what desert / land have you lived, where no one was kind enough to inform you that these / fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as / musty as they are ancient? I little expected, in this enlightened and / scientific age, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus. My dear / sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.</said>
      <said p="34">The ancient teachers of this science, said / he, promised impossibilities and performed nothing. / The modern masters promise very little; they know that metals cannot be / transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera. But these philosophers, / whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the / microscope or crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the / recesses of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend / into the heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature / of the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers; they / can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even mock the / invisible world with its own shadows.</said>
      <said p="35">These were men to whose indefatigable zeal / modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their / knowledge. They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names and / arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had / been the instruments of bringing to light. The labours of men of genius, / however erroneously directed, scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the / solid advantage of mankind.</said>
      <said p="35">I am happy,</said>
      <said pp="35-36">to have gained a disciple; and if your application / equals your ability, I have no doubt of your success. Chemistry is that branch / of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be / made; it is on that account that I have made it my peculiar study; but at the / same time, I have not neglected the other branches of science. A man would make / but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge / alone. If your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty / experimentalist, /  / I should advise you to apply to every / branch of natural philosophy, including mathematics.</said>
      <said p="41">I know that while you are pleased with / yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from / you. You must pardon me if I regard any interruption in your correspondence as / a proof that your other duties are equally neglected.</said>
      <said p="45">My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed he, / how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you / should be here at the very moment of my alighting!</said>
      <said p="46">You may easily / believe, said he, how great was the difficulty / to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the / noble art of bookkeeping; and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the / last, for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that / of the Dutch schoolmaster in / The Vicar of Wakefield: / I have ten thousand / florins a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek. But his / affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has / permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of / knowledge.</said>
      <said p="46">It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but / tell me how you left my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.</said>
      <said p="46">Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy / that they hear from you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little / upon their account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein, continued he, / stopping short and gazing full in my face, I did / not before remark how very ill you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you / had been watching for several nights.</said>
      <said p="46">You have guessed right; I have lately been so / deeply engaged in one occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient / rest, as you see; but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are / now at an end and that I am at length free.</said>
      <said p="47">My dear Victor, cried he, / what, for God's sake, is the matter? Do not / laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the cause of all this?</said>
      <said p="47">Do not ask me, cried I, putting my hands / before my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; / he can tell. Oh, save me! Save me!</said>
      <said p="48">Dearest Clerval, exclaimed I, / how kind, how very good you are to me. This whole / winter, instead of being spent in study, as you promised yourself, has been / consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever repay you? I feel the greatest / remorse for the disappointment of which I have been the occasion, but you will / forgive me.</said>
      <said p="48">You will repay me entirely if you do not / discompose yourself, but get well as fast as you can; and since you appear in / such good spirits, I may speak to you on one subject, may I not?</said>
      <said p="48">Compose yourself, ‌said Clerval, who observed / my change of colour, I will not mention it if it / agitates you; but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a / letter from you in your own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been / and are uneasy at your long silence.</said>
      <said pp="48-49">Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you / suppose /  / that my first thought would not fly towards those / dear, dear friends whom I love and who are so deserving of my love?</said>
      <said p="49">If this is your present temper, my friend, you / will perhaps be glad to see a letter that has been lying here some days for / you; it is from your cousin, I believe.</said>
      <said p="52">Dear, dear Elizabeth! I exclaimed when I had / read her letter. I will write instantly and relieve / them from the anxiety they must feel.</said>
      <said p="54">D—n the fellow! cried he. / Why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has outstripped us / all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A youngster who, but / a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly as in the Gospel, has / now set himself at the head of the university; and if he is not soon pulled / down, we shall all be out of countenance. Ay, ay, continued he, observing / my face expressive of suffering, M. / Frankenstein is modest, an excellent quality in a young man. Young men should / be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval; I was myself when young, / but that wears out in a very short time.</said>
      <said p="57">Oh, God! I have murdered my darling / child!</said>
      <said p="58">My dear Frankenstein, exclaimed Henry when / he perceived me weep with bitterness, are you / always to be unhappy? My dear friend, what has happened?</said>
      <said p="58">I can offer you no consolation, my friend, / ‌said he; your disaster is irreparable. What do you / intend to do?</said>
      <said p="58">To go instantly to Geneva; come with me, Henry, / to order the horses.</said>
      <said pp="58-59">Poor / William!  said he, dear lovely child, /  / he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had seen / him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss! / To die so miserably, to feel the murderer's grasp! How much more a / murderer, that could destroy such radiant innocence! Poor little fellow! One / only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but he is at rest. The / pang is over, his sufferings are at an end forever. A sod covers his gentle / form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer be a subject for pity; we must / reserve that for his miserable survivors.</said>
      <said pp="59-60">Dear /  / mountains! My own beautiful lake! How / do you welcome your wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue / and placid. Is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my / unhappiness?</said>
      <said p="61">William, dear angel! This is / thy funeral, this thy dirge!</said>
      <said p="63">Welcome, my dearest Victor, said he. / Ah! I wish you had come three months ago, and then / you would have found us all joyous and delighted. You come to us now to share a / misery which nothing can alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our / father, who seems sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will / induce poor Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations. Poor / William! He was our darling and our pride!</said>
      <said p="63">She most of all, said Ernest, / requires consolation; she accused herself of having / caused the death of my brother, and that made her very wretched. But since the / murderer has been discovered—</said>
      <said p="63">The murderer discovered! Good God! How can that / be? Who could attempt to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to / overtake the winds or confine a mountain stream with a straw. I saw him too; he / was free last night!</said>
      <said pp="63-64">I do not know what you mean, replied my / brother in accents of wonder, but to us the / discovery we have made completes our misery. No one would believe it at first; / and even now Elizabeth will not be convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. / Indeed, who would credit that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable and fond of / all /  / the family, could suddenly become capable of so / frightful, so appalling a crime?</said>
      <said p="64">Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the / accused? But it is wrongfully; everyone knows that; no one believes it, surely, / Ernest?</said>
      <said p="64">No one did at first, but several circumstances / came out that have almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has / been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear, / leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will then hear / all.</said>
      <said p="64">You are all mistaken; I know the / murderer. Justine, poor, good Justine, is innocent.</said>
      <said p="64">Good / God, Papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor / William.</said>
      <said p="64">We do also, unfortunately, replied / my father; for indeed I had rather have been / forever ignorant than have discovered so much depravity and ingratitude in one / I valued so highly.</said>
      <said p="64">My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is / innocent.</said>
      <said pp="64-65">If she is, God forbid that she should / suffer as guilty. /  / She is to be tried today, and I hope, I / sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.</said>
      <said p="65">Your arrival, my dear / cousin,  said she,fills me with hope. You / perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! Who is / safe, if she be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I / do upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only lost that / lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely love, is to be torn / away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I never shall know joy more. / But she will not, I am sure she will not; and then I shall be happy again, even / after the sad death of my little William.</said>
      <said p="65">She is innocent, my Elizabeth, said I, / and that shall be proved; fear nothing, but let your / spirits be cheered by the assurance of her acquittal.</said>
      <said p="65">How kind and generous you are! Everyone else / believes in her guilt, and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was / impossible; and to see everyone else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered / me hopeless and despairing.</said>
      <said pp="65-66">Dearest niece, said my father, / dry your tears. If she is, as you believe, / innocent, rely on the justice of our /  / laws, and the / activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality.</said>
      <said p="67">God knows, she said, / how entirely I am innocent. But I do not pretend / that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence on a plain and / simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me, and I hope / the character I have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable / interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious.</said>
      <said p="68">I know, continued the unhappy victim, / how heavily and fatally this one circumstance / weighs against me, but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have / expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left to conjecture concerning the / probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket. But here also I / am checked. I believe that I have no enemy on earth, and none surely would have / been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I / know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he / have stolen the jewel, to part with it again so soon? / I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, / yet I see no room for hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined / concerning my character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed / guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my / innocence.</said>
      <said p="69">I am, said she, / the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered, / or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived with his parents / ever since and even long before his birth. It may therefore be judged indecent / in me to come forward on this occasion, but when I see a fellow creature about / to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed / to speak, that I may say what I know of her character. I am well acquainted / with the accused. I have lived in the same house with her, at one time for five / and at another for nearly two years. During all that period she appeared to me / the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame / Frankenstein, my aunt, in her last illness, with the greatest affection and / care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a / manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again / lived in my uncle's house, where she was beloved by all the family. She / was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a / most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that, / notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely on / her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to the / bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it, I / should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value / her.</said>
      <said p="70">That / evidence,  he observed,was hardly required / in so glaring a case, but I am glad of it; and, indeed, none of our judges like / to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so / decisive.</said>
      <said p="70">My cousin, replied I, / it is decided as you may have expected; all judges / had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape. / But she has confessed.</said>
      <said p="70">Alas! said she. / How shall I ever again believe in human goodness? / Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as my sister, how could she put on those / smiles of innocence only to betray? Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any / severity or guile, and yet she has committed a murder.</said>
      <said p="71">Yes, said Elizabeth, / I will go, although she is guilty; and you, / Victor, shall accompany me; I cannot go alone.</said>
      <said p="71">Oh, Justine! said she. / Why did you rob me of my last consolation? I / relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I was not so / miserable as I am now.</said>
      <said p="71">And do you also believe that I am so very, very / wicked? Do you also join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a / murderer?</said>
      <said p="71">Rise, my poor girl, said Elizabeth; / why do you kneel, if you are innocent? I am not / one of your enemies; I believed you guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, / until I heard that you had yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, / is false; and be assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in / you for a moment, but your own confession.</said>
      <said p="71">I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I / confessed, that I might obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier / at my heart than all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I / was condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced, until I / almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I was. He threatened / excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if I continued obdurate. Dear / lady, I had none to support me; all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy / and perdition. What could I do? In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now / only am I truly miserable.</said>
      <said pp="71-72">I / thought /  / with horror, my sweet lady, that you should / believe your Justine, whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom / you loved, was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself / could have perpetrated. Dear William! Dearest blessed child! I soon shall see / you again in heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going / as I am to suffer ignominy and death.</said>
      <said p="72">Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one / moment distrusted you. Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not / fear. I will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony / hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die! You, my / playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold! No! No! I never / could survive so horrible a misfortune.</said>
      <said p="72">I do not fear / to die,  she said; that pang is past. God raises / my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter / world; and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I / am resigned to the fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in / patience to the will of heaven!</said>
      <said p="72">Dear sir, you are very kind to visit me; you, / I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?</said>
      <said p="72">No, Justine, said / Elizabeth; he is more convinced of your innocence / than I was, for even when he heard that you had confessed, he did not credit / it.</said>
      <said pp="72-73">I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel / the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet / is the affection of others to such a /  / wretch as I am! It / removes more than half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now / that my innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.</said>
      <said p="73">I wish, cried she, / that I were to die with you; I cannot live in / this world of misery.</said>
      <said p="73">Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth, / my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and preserve you; / may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer! Live, and be happy, / and make others so.</said>
      <said p="75">Do you think, Victor, said he, / that I do not suffer also? No one could / love a child more than I loved your brother — tears came into his eyes / as he spoke — but is it not a duty to / the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an / appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty owed to yourself, for / excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment, or even the discharge of / daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for society.</said>
      <said p="77">When I reflect, my dear cousin,  said she, / on the miserable death of Justine Moritz, I no / longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me. Before, I / looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard / from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils; at least they were / remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination; but now misery has / come home, and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other's / blood, Yet I am certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be / guilty, and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, / assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the / sake of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend, a / child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if it had / been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human being, but / certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society / of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel, she was innocent; you are of the / same opinion, and that confirms me. Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so / like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I / were walking on the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding / and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were / assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free, and / perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for / the same crimes, I would not change places with such a wretch.</said>
      <said pp="77-78">My dearest / friend, you must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how / deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of despair, / and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me tremble. Dear / Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the friends around you, /  /  / who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost the / power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are true to each / other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native country, we may reap / every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our peace?</said>
      <said p="82">Wandering spirits, / if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow beds, allow me this faint / happiness, or take me, as your companion, away from the joys of life.</said>
      <said p="83">Devil, I exclaimed, / do you dare approach me? And do not you fear the / fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head? Begone, vile insect! / Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And, oh! That I could, with / the extinction of your miserable existence, restore those victims whom you have / so diabolically murdered!</said>
      <said p="83">I expected this reception, said the demon. / All men hate the wretched; how, then, must I be / hated, who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you, my creator, detest / and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by / the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus / with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest / of mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at / peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated / with the blood of your remaining friends.</said>
      <said p="83">Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The / tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You / reproach me with your creation; come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark / which I so negligently bestowed.</said>
      <said pp="83-84">Be calm! I entreat / you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head. Have I / not suffered enough, that you seek to increase my misery? Life, although it may / only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear /  / to me, and I / will defend it. Remember, thou hast made me more powerful than thyself; my / height is superior to thine, my joints more supple. But I will not be tempted / to set myself in opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild / and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the / which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and / trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and / affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy / Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no / misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I / was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall / again be virtuous.</said>
      <said p="84">Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no / community between you and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our / strength in a fight, in which one must fall.</said>
      <said pp="84-85">How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause / thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and / compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed with / love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my creator, abhor / me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures, who owe me nothing? They / spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge. I / have wandered here many days; the caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a / dwelling to me, and the only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I / hail, for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of / mankind knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for / my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep no terms / with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my wretchedness. Yet it / is in your power to recompense me, and deliver them from an evil which it only / remains for you to make so great, that not only you and your family, but / thousands of others, shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let / your compassion be moved, and do /  / not disdain me. Listen / to my tale; when you have heard that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall / judge that I deserve. But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, / bloody as they are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. / Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with a / satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the eternal justice / of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me, and then, if you can, and / if you will, destroy the work of your hands.</said>
      <said p="85">Why do you call to my remembrance, I / rejoined, circumstances of which I shudder to / reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, / abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) / be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You / have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! / Relieve me from the sight of your detested form.</said>
      <said p="85">Thus I relieve thee, my creator,</said>
      <said p="85">thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. / Still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that / I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, / and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come / to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it / descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another / world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests whether I / quit forever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life, or become the / scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy / ruin.</said>
      <said p="101">Good night, sweet / Safie.</said>
      <said p="112">Hateful day when I received life! / I exclaimed in agony. Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster / so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man / beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of / yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, / fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am solitary and / abhorred.</said>
      <said p="115">Who is there?  said / the old man. Come in.</said>
      <said p="115">Pardon this intrusion,  said I; I / am a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you / would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.</said>
      <said p="115">Enter,  said De Lacey, and I will try in what / manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are from / home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to procure food / for you.</said>
      <said p="115">Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is / warmth and rest only that I need.</said>
      <said p="115">By your language, stranger, I suppose / you are my countryman; are you French?</said>
      <said pp="115-116">No, but I was educated by a French family and understand that / language only. I am now going to claim /  / the protection / of some friends, whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some / hopes.</said>
      <said p="116">Are they Germans?</said>
      <said p="116">No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an / unfortunate and deserted creature; I look around and I have no relation or / friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me and / know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail there, I am an outcast in / the world forever.</said>
      <said p="116">Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, / but the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are full / of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes; and if these / friends are good and amiable, do not despair.</said>
      <said p="116">They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in / the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good / dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial; / but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling / and kind friend, they behold only a detestable monster.</said>
      <said p="116">That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, / cannot you undeceive them?</said>
      <said p="116">I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account / that I feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I / have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily kindness / towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and it is that / prejudice which I wish to overcome.</said>
      <said p="116">Where do these friends reside?</said>
      <said p="116">Near this spot.</said>
      <said p="116">If you will / unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of / use in undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but / there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere. I am / poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way / serviceable to a human creature.</said>
      <said pp="116-117">Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous /  / offer. You raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust / that, by your aid, I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your / fellow creatures.</said>
      <said p="117">Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can / only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am / unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent; judge, / therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.</said>
      <said p="117">How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your / lips first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall be / forever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success with those / friends whom I am on the point of meeting.</said>
      <said p="117">May I know the names and residence of those friends?</said>
      <said p="117">Now is the time! Save and protect me! You and your / family are the friends whom I seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of / trial!</said>
      <said p="117">Great God!</said>
      <said p="117">Who are you?</said>
      <said pp="119-120">Do you consider, said his companion to / him, that /  / you will be obliged to pay three / months' rent and to lose the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take / any unfair advantage, and I beg therefore that you will take some days to / consider of your determination.</said>
      <said p="120">It is utterly useless, replied Felix; / we can never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest / danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and my / sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason with / me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this / place.</said>
      <said p="124">Child, what is the meaning of this? / I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.</said>
      <said p="124">Let me go,</said>
      <said p="124">monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear / me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.</said>
      <said p="124">Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with / me.</said>
      <said p="124">Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. / Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.</said>
      <said p="124">Frankenstein! You belong then to my enemy—to him towards / whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.</said>
      <said p="124">I too can create / desolation; my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, / and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.</said>
      <said p="125">Awake, fairest, thy lover / is near—he who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection / from thine eyes; my beloved, awake!</said>
      <said p="126">You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the / interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, / and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.</said>
      <said p="126">I do refuse it, I replied; / and no torture / shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of / men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another / like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have / answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.</said>
      <said p="126">You are in the wrong,</said>
      <said pp="126-127">and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. / I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? / You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why / I should pity man more than he pities me? You would /  / not call it / murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my / frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let / him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would / bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But / that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet / mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; / if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my / arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a / care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, / so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.</said>
      <said p="127">I intended to reason. This passion is / detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. / If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a / hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace / with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be / realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of / another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is / all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be / monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more / attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless / and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel / gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of / some existing thing; do not deny me my request!</said>
      <said p="128">If you consent, neither you nor any other human being / shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food / is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; / acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of / the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make / our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our / food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel / that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as / you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the / favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently / desire.</said>
      <said p="128">You propose,  replied I, to fly from the / habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will / be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of / man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, / and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, / and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This / may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.</said>
      <said p="128">How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were / moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my / complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made / me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and / dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will / have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and / in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.</said>
      <said p="129">You swear,  I said, to be harmless; but have / you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me / distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by / affording a wider scope for your revenge?</said>
      <said p="129">How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an / answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my / portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall / become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the / children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily / arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a / sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from / which I am now excluded.</said>
      <said p="129">I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe / forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall / deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.</said>
      <said pp="129-130">I swear,  he cried, by the sun, and by the / blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you / grant my prayer, while they exist you shall /  / never / behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch / their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are / ready I shall appear.</said>
      <said p="130">Oh! / Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, / crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, / depart, and leave me in darkness.</said>
      <said p="132">I am happy to remark, my dear son, that / you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. / And yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was / lost in conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me, / and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point / would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.</said>
      <said p="132">I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your / marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the / stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest / infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, / entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man that what / I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed / it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might / become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and / considering yourself as bound in honour to Elizabeth, this struggle may / occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.</said>
      <said p="132">My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly / and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my warmest / admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up / in the expectation of our union.</said>
      <said pp="132-133">The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear / Victor, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you / feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom / over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of / your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to / an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and /  / recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity / befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, / possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at / all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have / formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or / that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my / words with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and / sincerity.</said>
      <said p="136">This is what it is to live,  he cried; now I enjoy / existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are you desponding and / sorrowful!</said>
      <said pp="136-137">I have seen,  he said, the most beautiful /  / scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of / Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to / the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy / and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve / the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, / when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the / water-spout must be on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base / of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an / avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the / pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the / Pays de Vaud; but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. / The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a / charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled. Look / at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, / almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group / of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half hid in the / recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this / place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or / retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.</said>
      <said p="142">I could pass my life here, said he to me; / and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland / and the Rhine.</said>
      <said p="143">Do / you,  said I, enjoy yourself, and let this be our rendezvous. / I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with my motions, I entreat / you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I return, I hope / it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own temper.</said>
      <said p="144">I had rather be with / you,  he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these / Scotch people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return, / that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in your / absence.</said>
      <said p="148">You have destroyed the work which you / began; what is it that you intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have / endured toil and misery; I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores / of the Rhine, among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I / have dwelt many months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of / Scotland. I have endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you / dare destroy my hopes?</said>
      <said p="148">Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another / like yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.</said>
      <said p="148">Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved / yourself unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe / yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will / be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master; obey!</said>
      <said p="148">The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your / power is arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but / they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice. / Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a demon whose delight is in / death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your words will only exasperate / my rage.</said>
      <said p="148">Shall each man,</said>
      <said pp="148-149">find a wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be / alone? I had feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and / scorn. Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery, / and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness forever. / Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness? You /  / can blast my other passions, but revenge / remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but / first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your / misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with the / wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall repent of / the injuries you inflict.</said>
      <said p="149">Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of / malice. I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend / beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.</said>
      <said p="149">It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your / wedding-night.</said>
      <said p="149">Villain! Before you sign my / death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.</said>
      <said p="152">Fiend, / I exclaimed, your task is already fulfilled!</said>
      <said p="153">My good friends,  said I, will / you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I / am?</said>
      <said p="153">You will know that soon enough,</said>
      <said p="153">Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove / much to your taste, but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I / promise you.</said>
      <said p="154">Why do you answer me so roughly? I / replied. Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive / strangers so inhospitably.</said>
      <said p="154">I do not know,  said the man, what the custom / of the English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate / villains.</said>
      <said p="154">Come, sir, you must follow me to Mr. / Kirwin's to give an account of yourself.</said>
      <said p="154">Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is / not this a free country?</said>
      <said p="154">Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a / magistrate, and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was / found murdered here last night.</said>
      <said p="157">Have / my murderous machinations deprived you also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I / have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my / friend, my benefactor—</said>
      <said p="158">Are you better now, / sir?</said>
      <said p="158">I believe / I am; but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am / still alive to feel this misery and horror.</said>
      <said p="158">For that matter,  replied the old woman, if / you mean about the gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for / you if you were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, / that's none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do / my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.</said>
      <said p="159">I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do / anything to make you more comfortable?</said>
      <said p="159">I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the / whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.</said>
      <said p="159">I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little / relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I / hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can easily be / brought to free you from the criminal charge.</said>
      <said pp="159-160">That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange /  / events, become the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted / and tortured as I am and have been, can death be any evil to me?</said>
      <said p="160">Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonizing than / the strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some / surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality, seized / immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was presented to / your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so unaccountable a manner / and placed, as it were, by some fiend across your path.</said>
      <said p="160">Immediately / upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on your person were brought / me, and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send / to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness. I found several / letters, and, among others, one which I discovered from its commencement to be / from your father. I instantly wrote to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed / since the departure of my letter. But you are ill; even now you tremble; you / are unfit for agitation of any kind.</said>
      <said p="160">This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible / event; tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am / now to lament?</said>
      <said p="160">Your family is perfectly well,</said>
      <said p="160">and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.</said>
      <said p="161">Oh! Take him away! I cannot see / him; for God's sake, do not let him enter!</said>
      <said p="161">I should have thought, young man, that the presence / of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent / repugnance.</said>
      <said p="161">My father!</said>
      <said p="161">Is my father indeed come? / How kind, how very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?</said>
      <said p="161">Are you, then, safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?</said>
      <said p="161">What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!</said>
      <said p="161">You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems to pursue you. / And poor Clerval—</said>
      <said p="161">Alas! Yes, my father,  replied I; some / destiny of the most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, / or surely I should have died on the coffin of Henry.</said>
      <said p="165">Alas! My father,  said I, how little do you / know me. Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if / such a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent / as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause of / this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all died by / my hands.</said>
      <said p="166">My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat / you never to make such an assertion again.</said>
      <said p="166">I am not mad,  I cried energetically; the sun / and the heavens, who have viewed my operations, can hear witness of my truth. I / am the assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations. A / thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved / their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not sacrifice the whole / human race.</said>
      <said p="169">I fear, my beloved girl, I said, / little happiness remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day / enjoy is centred in you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I / consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, / Elizabeth, a dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with / horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only wonder / that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of misery and / terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place, for, my sweet / cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But until then, I conjure / you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most earnestly entreat, and I know / you will comply.</said>
      <said p="170">Have you, then, some other attachment?</said>
      <said p="170">None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union / with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate / myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.</said>
      <said p="170">My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have / befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love / for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be small but / bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune. And when time shall / have softened your despair, new and dear objects of care will be born to / replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived.</said>
      <said p="173">You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! / If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would endeavour / to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least / permits me to enjoy.</said>
      <said p="173">Be happy, my dear Victor,  replied Elizabeth;there is, I hope, nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a / lively joy is not painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers / to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I / will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move along and / how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of / Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more interesting. Look also at / the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters, where we can / distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom. What a divine day! How happy / and serene all nature appears!</said>
      <said p="174">What is it that agitates you, my dear / Victor? What is it you fear?</said>
      <said p="174">Oh! Peace, peace, my love,  replied I; this / night, and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.</said>
      <said p="178">Be / assured, sir,  said he, no pains or exertions on my part shall / be spared to discover the villain.</said>
      <said pp="178-179">I thank you,  replied I; listen, therefore, / to the deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I / should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which, / however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to be / mistaken /  / for a dream, and I have no motive for / falsehood.</said>
      <said p="179">This is the being / whom I accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert / your whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that / your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on / this occasion.</said>
      <said p="179">I would willingly afford you every aid / in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers / which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an animal which / can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would / venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since the commission of / his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what / region he may now inhabit.</said>
      <said p="179">I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, / and if he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the / chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do / not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the / punishment which is his desert.</said>
      <said p="180">You are mistaken,  said he. I will exert myself, / and if it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer / punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have yourself / described to be his properties, that this will prove impracticable; and thus, / while every proper measure is pursued, you should make up your mind to / disappointment.</said>
      <said p="180">That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little / avail. My revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I / confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage is / unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned loose upon / society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have but one resource, and / I devote myself, either in my life or death, to his destruction.</said>
      <said p="180">Man, I cried, / how ignorant art thou in thy / pride of wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.</said>
      <said pp="181-182">By the sacred / earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the deep and / eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the spirits that / preside over thee, to pursue the demon who caused this misery, until he or I / shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will preserve my life; to / execute this dear /  / revenge will I again behold the sun / and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my / eyes forever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering / ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed and / hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now torments / me.</said>
      <said p="182">I / am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have determined to live, and I am satisfied.</said>
      <said p="189">Are you mad, my friend? said he. / Or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for / yourself and  world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do / not seek to increase your own.</said>
      <said p="189">Since you have preserved my narration, / said he, I would not that a mutilated one / should go down to posterity.</said>
      <said p="190">When younger, said he, I believed myself / destined for some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a / coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This / sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been / oppressed, for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those / talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the / work I had completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and / rational animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. / But this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now / serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes are / as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am chained in / an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of analysis and / application were intense; by the union of these qualities I conceived the idea / and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot recollect without passion / my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod heaven in my thoughts, now / exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea of their effects. From my / infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition; but how am I sunk! / Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once was, you would not recognize me in / this state of degradation. Despondency rarely visited my heart; a high destiny / seemed to bear me on, until I fell, never, never again to rise.</said>
      <said p="191">I thank you, Walton, he said, / for your kind / intentions towards so miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and / fresh affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any / man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even where the / affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence, the companions of / our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any / later friend can obtain. They know our infantine dispositions, which, however / they may be afterwards modified, are never eradicated; and they can judge of / our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A / sister or a brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown / early, suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend, / however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be contemplated / with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only through habit and / association, but from their own merits; and wherever I am, the soothing voice / of my Elizabeth and the conversation of Clerval will be ever whispered in my / ear. They are dead, and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to / preserve my life. If I were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught / with extensive utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. / But such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I gave / existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.</said>
      <said pp="193-194">What do you / mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then, so easily turned from / your design? Did you not call this a glorious expedition? And wherefore was it / glorious? Not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea, but / because it was full of dangers and terror, because at every new incident your / fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited, because danger and / death surrounded it, and these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it / a glorious, for this was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be / hailed as the benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to / brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now, / behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first mighty / and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content to be / handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril; and / so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides. Why, / that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come thus far and dragged / your captain to the /  / shame of a defeat merely to prove / yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your purposes / and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; / it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not. Do not / return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows. / Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to / turn their backs on the foe.</said>
      <said p="195">They shout,  I said, because they / will soon return to England.</said>
      <said p="195">Do you, then, really return?</said>
      <said p="195">Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead / them unwillingly to danger, and I must return.</said>
      <said p="195">Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your / purpose, but mine is assigned to me by heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but / surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient / strength.</said>
      <said pp="195-196">Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall soon / die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think not, Walton, / that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning hatred and ardent / desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself justified in desiring the / death of my adversary. During these last days I have been occupied in examining / my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable. In a fit of enthusiastic madness I / created a rational creature and was bound towards /  / him / to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being. This was my / duty, but there was another still paramount to that. My duties towards the / beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they / included a greater proportion of happiness or misery. Urged by this view, I / refused, and I did right in refusing, to create a companion for the first / creature. He showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil; he / destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite / sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I know where this thirst for / vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he / ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed. When / actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I asked you to undertake my unfinished / work, and I renew this request now, when I am only induced by reason and / virtue. / Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this / task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have little chance of / meeting with him. But the consideration of these points, and the well balancing / of what you may esteem your duties, I leave to you; my judgment and ideas are / already disturbed by the near approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what / I think right, for I may still be misled by passion. / That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs / me; in other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the / only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of the beloved / dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell, Walton! Seek / happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it be only the apparently / innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries. Yet why do / I say this? I have myself been blasted in these hopes, yet another may / succeed.</said>
      <said pp="197-198">That is also my victim!  he exclaimed. In his / murder my crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to / its close! Oh, Frankenstein! /  / Generous and self-devoted / being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who / irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, / he cannot answer me.</said>
      <said p="198">Your repentance,</said>
      <said p="198">is now superfluous. If you had listened to the voice of / conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your / diabolical vengeance to this extremity, Frankenstein would yet have / lived.</said>
      <said pp="198-199">And do you dream?  said the demon. Do you / think that I was then dead to agony and remorse? He, he continued, pointing / to the corpse, he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. / Oh! Not the ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the / lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me on, while / my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the groans of Clerval were / music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and / sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred, it did not endure the / violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine. / After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, / heart-broken and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I / abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of my / existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for happiness, that / while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own / enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which I was forever / barred, then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an / insatiable /  / thirst for vengeance. I recollected my threat / and resolved that it should be accomplished. I knew that I was preparing for / myself a deadly torture, but I was the slave, not the master, of an impulse / which I detested yet could not disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not / miserable. I had cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the / excess of my despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no / choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly chosen. The / completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion. And now it is / ended; there is my last victim!</said>
      <said p="199">Wretch! I said. / It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made. You / throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are consumed, you sit / among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend! If he whom you mourn / still lived, still would he be the object, again would he become the prey, of / your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you feel; you lament only because / the victim of your malignity as withdrawn from your power.</said>
      <said pp="199-202">Oh, it is not thus—not thus, interrupted the / being. Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what / appears to be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my / misery. No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of / virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being / overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has become to / me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and / loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am content to suffer / alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am well satisfied that / abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once my fancy was soothed with / dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with / beings who, pardoning my /  / outward form, would love me / for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was nourished / with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has degraded me / beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no malignity, no misery, can / be found comparable to mine. When I run over the frightful catalogue of my / sins, I cannot believe that I am the same creature whose thoughts were once / filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of / goodness. But it is even so; the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet / even that enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I / am alone. / You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my / crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them he / could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured wasting in / impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did not satisfy my own / desires. They were forever ardent and craving; still I desired love and / fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be / thought the only criminal, when all humankind sinned against me? Why do you not / hate Felix, who drove his friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not / execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these / are virtuous and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an / abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood / boils at the recollection of this injustice. / But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the / helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his / throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have devoted my / creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among / men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin. There he / lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but your abhorrence cannot equal / that with which I regard myself. I look on the hands which executed the deed; I / think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for /  / the moment when these hands will meet my eyes, when that / imagination will haunt my thoughts no more. / Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work is / nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate / the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires / my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this sacrifice. I shall / quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the / most northern extremity of the globe; I shall collect my funeral pile and / consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its remains may afford no light to / any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as I have been. / I shall die. I shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the / prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet unquenched. He is dead who called me into / being; and when I shall be no more, the very remembrance of us both will / speedily vanish. I shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play / on my cheeks. Light, feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition / must I find my happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world / affords first opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and / heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were / all to me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted / by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in / death? / Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom / these eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive and / yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better satiated in my / life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou didst seek my extinction, / that I might not cause greater wretchedness; and if yet, in some mode unknown / to me, thou hadst not ceased to think and feel, thou wouldst not desire against / me a vengeance greater than that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony / was still superior to thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to / rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever. /  /  / But soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, /  I shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these / burning miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly / and exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration / will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit / will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus. / Farewell.</said>
