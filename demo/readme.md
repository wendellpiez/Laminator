# Laminator Demonstrations

These are underway or planned.

Currently the demonstrations produce SVG diagrams, but xMNML is capable of much more than illustration.

## baselines

[Very small LMNL examples](baselines/readme.md).

- intelligible and easy to understand
- exercising all the features
- suitable for demo and also regression testing (as functional baselines)

Pipelines can be used both to test and to demonstrate functionality.

## Sonnets

Bubble diagrams from LMNL sonnets showing overlapping hierarchies - verse/line vs sentence/phrase

## Story Lines

Showing arbitrary narrative structures, especially narrative nesting, even when overlapping structural boundaries --

Mary Shelley's **Frankenstein** (1831 ed.)

Percy Shelley, **Julian and Madallo**

Lucian, **De Morte Peregrini**

## Analytics (planned)

Generic MNML LMNL analytics, such as overlap reporters and lightweight validators.
