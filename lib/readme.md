# Laminator libraries

Generic code for working with MNML LMNL.

See the readme documents and code base for the current state.

Test pipelines and XSpec tests can be found close to their test targets.

Planned and underway:

## Acquisition

- Parsing LMNL syntax (MNML subset) to build xMNML (XML)
- Converting XML into xMNML

## Expression

- Producing LMNL syntax from xMNML - LMNL serialization
- Producing XML from xMNML - building trees from ranges

## Support

- Serializing XML in LMNL syntax
- Process xMNML natively:
  - To modify documents
  - To filter and merge range sets
  - Validation, diagnostics, restoration
  - Analytics
