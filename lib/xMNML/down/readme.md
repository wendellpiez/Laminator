# xMNML Down

This code has been ported from earlier work and could do with cleanup and simplification.

Unit tests are included for a couple of vital processes.

xMNML-build.xsl - builds 'honest' XML from any xLMNL

xMNML-xml-ripper.xsl - CHEATS to write XML the dishonest way
  (works for some inputs)

xMNML-write-sawteeth.xsl - writes LMNL syntax from xMNML inputs (any xMNML inputs)
